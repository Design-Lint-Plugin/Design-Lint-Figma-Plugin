/**
 * The Tailwind design system, and the two questions rules ask of it.
 *
 * Three rules need to know things that only Tailwind can answer — which utility prefixes
 * carry a colour, whether a class generates any CSS at all, and whether a *particular*
 * class sets a colour. A hand-written prefix list answers the first and never asks the
 * third, and it is wrong in both directions: `text-sm/6` reports, because `text-` is a
 * colour prefix, and `inset-ring-primary` is invisible, because nobody listed `inset-ring`.
 *
 * Everything here is **derived by probing the design system**. Nothing is a list someone
 * has to remember to update when Tailwind adds a utility family.
 *
 * ## What this needs, and what it does not
 *
 * It needs `tailwindcss` and *a* stylesheet. It does not need the consuming project's
 * stylesheet, and the difference decides where this module can be built and tested.
 * Two separate facts decide whether a class carries colour:
 *
 * - **Which utilities exist, and what each generates.** `bg-*` sets `background-color`
 *   and `text-<size>` sets `font-size` in every project there has ever been. This comes
 *   from Tailwind core, and `@import "tailwindcss";` on its own loads all of it.
 * - **Which token names resolve.** `bg-primary` is a project's own business, and that is
 *   what the consumer's `tokenFiles` supply at load.
 *
 * Prefix derivation asks only the first. So it is probed against whatever design system
 * was loaded, and the fixture in `test/fixtures/theme.css` is a *wider* probe surface than
 * a real application stylesheet — a project that narrows the default palette narrows what
 * a probe can see.
 *
 * The one genuinely project-specific input is a Tailwind plugin that introduces a new
 * colour prefix, and that arrives through the `colorPrefixes` option, which *adds* to the
 * derived set rather than replacing it.
