/**
 * Rule options the contracts are written against.
 *
 * These are fixtures, not the recommended policy. A rule's recommended policy is its own
 * default; this file supplies only what a consumer's config would, and the inputs the
 * factory would resolve from it.
 *
 * ## Resolved inputs, not paths
 *
 * Five of the nine rules need a design system or a semantic token set. Their contracts
 * configure that as `tokenFiles` — *paths*, because that is what a consumer
 * has — but no rule may read a file: paths are resolved once at plugin-module load and the
 * rules are handed the result. The corpus is that load step's stand-in, so it supplies the
 * resolved forms under the two keys a rule actually reads:
 *
 * | Option | What a rule gets |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `designSystem` | the policy view from `designSystemPolicy()` — `colorPrefixes`, `resolves`, `isColorClass` |
 * | `tokens` | a `Set` of semantic token names, `--color-` prefix already stripped |
 *
 * Neither of those can travel through `options`: they cross a JSON boundary and arrive as
 * husks with every method gone. They are *bound* to the rule instead — see {@link ruleFor},
 * which is the corpus's stand-in for the plugin module's load step. `optionsFor` describes
 * the other half, the JSON a consumer actually writes.
 *
 * Which means the corpus can vary either one per case without inventing a stylesheet per
 * variation, and `RuleTester` never touches a
 * filesystem.

/**
 * ## Why there is more than one design system here
 *
 * `theme.css` is a **probe surface**, not an application's palette: it exists so prefix
 * derivation can ask Tailwind what it generates, and it declares four deliberately generic
 * token names. Three contracts are written in token vocabularies it does not have —
 * `no-component-color-override` in `destructive` and `success-content`,
 * `no-undefined-token` in a palette that must *exclude* `danger-muted`, `token-constraints`
 * in fifteen names its contract lists in prose.
 *
 * Each of them resolves its own design system rather than widening the shared one, and that
 * is the rule to follow when a fourth needs the same thing. Widening `theme.css` moves every
 * other rule's verdicts as a side effect: adding `danger-muted` would make it defined for
 * `no-undefined-token`, and removing it would make it spectral for `no-spectral-color`. A
 * fixture that one rule can change to suit itself is a fixture no rule can rely on.

 * a font size, and nothing but the theme can tell them apart. Its contract is written in
 * the semantic vocabulary a design system actually has, so `theme.css`'s four probe names
 * are not enough: `destructive`, `danger`, `muted`, `info`, `success` and `border` have to
 * resolve for `text-destructive` to be a colour rather than a typo.
 *
 * So this is one more design system, resolved from the fixture stylesheet plus the names
 * that contract needs. It is deliberately *not* a change to `test/fixtures/theme.css`:
 * that file is a shared probe surface, and widening the colour namespace under every rule
 * would move `no-undefined-token`'s and `no-spectral-color`'s verdicts as a side effect of
 * a third rule's corpus. These names stand in for the consumer stylesheets passed to

 * `theme.css` above has the wrong ones. It defines `danger-muted`, which that contract
 * names as its running example of a token nobody defined, and it defines none of `warning`,
 * `input` or `success-content`, which the contract allows because they resolve. Under the
 * shared probe surface the rule would be right and the contract would look wrong.

 * `semanticDesignSystem` above could layer onto it and this cannot: a `@theme` block can add
 * a colour to a design system, and nothing can take one away.
 *
 * `sparseTokens` is the same palette as names. The rule builds its typo candidates from it —
